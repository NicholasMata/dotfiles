# Dotfiles

This is a repository to store my personal dotfiles. I would recommend creating and setting up your own dotfiles.

NOTE: I use GNU stow to apply all the dotfiles in the repo to my home directory.

## Features

### [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)

I use kitty as my terminal the dotfiles located in this repo enable the following features with this terminal.

- Both light and dark themes
- Other terminal specific styling

### SKHD

I use SKHD specifically with yabai for keyboard shortcuts. It can do much more than this, but this is my use case.

### Yabai (Tiling Window Manager)

I use yabai as my tiling window manager. This is because I am on MacOS and I find it to be the best one.

### LunarVim

I use LunarVim as my chosen editor. In the future I would like move off this to use pure neovim.

### Powerline10k

[Powerline10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) is what makes the terminal prompt look beautiful. 
The important thing here is too make sure you install Nerd Font as well.
My configuration mainly just has the prompt styled how I like it. I just modified the original file that was generated by powerline which is why it is so large.

### zsh-autosuggestions

[This](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) gives terminal command suggestions based on previously entered commands.

### zsh-completions

[This](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions) provides completion suggestions below the prompt, in addition to a history menu.

### zsh-syntax-highlighting

[This](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) is used to add syntax highlighting for terminal commands.

## Keymaps

I needed the below so I could visually see all my keymaps, thinking of making a web app for this.
